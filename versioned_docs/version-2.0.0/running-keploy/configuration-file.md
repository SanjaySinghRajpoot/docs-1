Tired of specifying the same container name, app command, or delay for each record or test command? ðŸ˜´

Introducing Keploy-config ðŸŽ‰

It is a YAML-based file that will allow you to define the testing configurations, including container setups, delays, and any other relevant parameters.

To generate a keploy-config file, run:

```bash
keploy generate-config --path "/path/to/your/project"
```

After successful execution of the command, a default initialized config file has been created. ðŸ¥³
